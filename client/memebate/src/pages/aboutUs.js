        Membate was created by James D. Beeks and the idea came about after
        years of watching his family debate, well not debate, but talk over one
        another to try to get theier point across and no one actually listening
        to one another. It came to a catalyst when he was watching the 2020
        debates with first then president Donald J. Trump and then candidate
        former Vice Presidetn Joe Biden's first debate. It was such a disaster
        that Joe Biden couldn't get a word in and it looked really bad on the
        Don. Then after watching the civil debates between then Vice president
        Mike Pence and VP running mat Kamala Harris it dawned James to make an
        app where people can have a voice to be heard and give other a chance to
        respond 'orally' without talking over each other and having to type out
        long text language that does not accurately portray what is being
        delineated.
